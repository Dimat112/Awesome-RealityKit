A collection of RealityKit projects and resources. Feel free to contribute!

The RealityKit framework was built from the ground up specifically for augmented reality with photo-realistic rendering, camera effects, animations, physics, and more. With native Swift APIs, ARKit integration, incredibly realistic physics-based rendering, transform and skeletal animations, spatial audio, and rigid body physics, RealityKit makes AR development faster and easier than ever before.
